Just simply navigate through the repository to the folder of your choice, and then hit 'download'!
Make sure to download all files associated with a particular blend file. It will contain textures that can be 
re-assigned to the proper inputs by clicking the folder icon on the image texture node within the shader node editor.

Same goes for text! there is a 'Text Tester' blend file that you can use to test your fonts in 3d. Navigate to the 'a'
symbol in the properties pane and under fonts you can find your sizes and styling. Use extrude under geometry to give it some depth!
